The Turing Agent
A Small Gameboy CTF

---

You find yourself playing a dull game of email roulette, which involves mindlessly and continuously refreshing your mailbox in hopes of a receiving news about a new mission. You never imagined that your job as a Turing Agent would come to this; the work these days has slowed to a crawl as the agency has had fewer rampant AIs to subdue. You get a funny sensation from your morality meter as you catch yourself wishing for a cyber calamity.

A fateful ding announces your long awaited packet. A neat stack of files gleam at you from advanced desktop simulation (now with four sides!).

The stack includes a README, which incidentally is where you are receiving these thoughts from right now. The README would like to take a second to thank you for processing these files in the proper order.

The README then informs you that your next destination should be tools.txt, which is a little memo from your boss. It would be in your best interest to skim it over to properly prepare for the mission at hand.

The README will not fail to mention that you will find two small hints tucked away at the bottom of the stack, if you find yourself with no where left to turn.

Last but not least, the mission comes in the form of a binary of sorts. And now, the README will leave the rest of the thinking to you.

Off you go! The README would like to inform you that you are done reading, and appreciates that you stayed until the last word. But really, there's really no need to be so diligent. The README is merely rambling meaninglessly now.

You are jerked out of the email simulation, which is a sensation that is comparable to a minor whiplash from a car collision with your neighbor's mailbox. You shake yourself off and you feel more than ready to tackle your mission.
